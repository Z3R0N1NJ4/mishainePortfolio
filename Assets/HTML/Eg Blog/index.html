                <p>Why Sort Of? Because we don’t really have quantities for you. It’s more like… inspiration. It really depends on your taste. So mix it up the way you like it and let us know how it goes!</p>

                <p>Luckybird comes to you from the makers of Sir Fruit, South Africa’s #1 cold pressed juice, health shots and fresh cocktail mix brand. With 30+ years in the industry, the ever-evolving Sir Fruit, says that they’ve produced these syrups and purees to “transform regular life into flavourful living, designed to inspire and enable creativity, elevating beverages and desserts to new heights.”</p>

                <p>We gave the Luckybird African Ginger syrup a spin (scroll down to see what other flavours are in the mix) and when we were toying with what to create, one of us was in the mood for a gin and the other felt like ice cream. So we did what any rational humans would do – put the two together.</p>
